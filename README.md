## FastAPI - NGINX - Static Web File - Starter

This minimal example demonstrates how to use NGINX and FastAPI to serve static files and expose API endpoints.

### Path Structure:

* **API Endpoint**: The API path is accessible via `/api`.
* **Static Files**: Static files are served from the `/static` path.
* **Static Website**: The static website content is served from the root path `/`.

### Nginx Configuration:

* The NGINX configuration files are located in the `nginx/conf.d` folder.

- ./www/html:/var/www/html
- ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
- ./static:/var/static
